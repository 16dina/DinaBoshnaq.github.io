											<p style="margin: 0; padding: 0; font-size: 14px;">I am a 20 year-old student at Thomas More. I came to Belgium around 2 years ago and have been living here ever since then. Programming and the field of Computer Science in general has been a part of my life 
											ever since middle school. It eventually became my career path as I'm studying Applied Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I currently live in a student house in Geel, but originally I live in Luik with my family.</p>
											<p style="margin: 0; padding: 0; font-size: 14px;">
												Ever since a young age, I've lived an international life. I experienced learning and working with people from around the world, which is also the reason I know English really well and consider myself bilingual in it.
												I've lived in Malaysia as a kid, in Palestine which is my home country, in the USA on exchange, in Turkey, and now Belgium. All these experiences made me adaptable to change and curious to try new things. It definitely enhanced my comunication skills with people of different cultures too.

								<h2>My Educational Journey</h2>
								<p>
									My early education consisted of attending international schools in Malaysia and local public schools in Palestine, Gaza. Later on in high school I went on exchange during 11th grade to the USA through a scholarship called the Keneddy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (KL-YES) program.
									I graduated high school in the scientific stream with a %95.4 gpa. I would also add a 3 year program called Code For Palestine to my education. It is a program for teaching middle and high school students programming and design thinking skills. I consider it a mile stone in my education
									as it shaped my perspective on what I want to study in college. Our instructors in this programs consisted of American mentors from Stanford University and local Palestinian mentors.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/thomasmore.png" alt="Thomas More" /></div>
								<p>Currently I study Applied Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at Thomas More University of Applied Sciences in Belgium. My education thus far has been well-rounded with a focus on both practical and soft skills.
									Each day I learn more about what the real world and job market is like, majority our learning is based on hands on projects and team work.
